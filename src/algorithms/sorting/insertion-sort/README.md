# Insertion Sort

*Insertion sort* is a sorting algorithm, specifically an in-place comparison sort. It is much more inefficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, and merge sort. But, *insertion sort* is noted for being extremely fast in smaller lists and/or lists that are already nearly sorted.

## Complexities

### Time Complexity

- Best: `O(n)`
- Average: `O(n^2)`
- Worst: `O(n^2)`

### Space Complexity

- Memory: `O(1)`
- Stable: `No`
