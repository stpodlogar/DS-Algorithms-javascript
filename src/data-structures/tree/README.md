- [Binary Search Tree](/binary-search-tree)

*Trees* are well-known as a non-linear data structure. They donâ€™t store data in a linear way. They organize data hierarchically. In computer science, a *tree* simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.
