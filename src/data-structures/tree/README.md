# Tree

- [Binary Search Tree](/binary-search-tree)

*Trees* are well-known as a non-linear data structure. They donâ€™t store data in a linear way. They organize data hierarchically. In computer science, a *tree* simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.

Above is an example of a general tree data structure. There is also a more specific form of tree called a binary tree.

### Binary Tree

- A *Binary Tree* is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the *left child* and *right child*
- **Full Tree**: a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children
- **Perfect Binary Tree**: a binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leave have the same depth
- **Complete Tree**: a binary tree in which every level except possibly the last is full and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible
