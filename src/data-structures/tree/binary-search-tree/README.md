# Binary Search Tree

A *binary search tree*, sometimes called BST, is a type of binary tree which maintains the property that the value in each node must be greater than or equal to any value stored in the left sub-tree, and less than or equal to any value stored in the right sub-tree

## Complexities

### Time Complexity

- Access: `O(log(n))`
- Search: `O(log(n))`
- Insertion: `O(log(n))`
- Deletion: `O(log(n))`
