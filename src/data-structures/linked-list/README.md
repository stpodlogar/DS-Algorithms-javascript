# Linked List

A *Linked List* is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes, each pointing to the next node by means of a pointer. It is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence.

- **Singly-linked list**: linked list in which each node points to the next node and the last node points to null
- **Doubly-linked list**: linked list in which each node has two pointers, p and n, such that p points to the previous node and n points to the next node; the last node's n pointer points to null

## Complexities

### Time Complexity

- Access: `O(n)`
- Search: `O(n)`
- Insertion: `O(1)`
- Deletion: `O(1)`
