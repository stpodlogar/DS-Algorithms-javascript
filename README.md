# Javascript Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains examples and implementations of commonly used data structures and algorithms, as well as example problems, all written in JavaScript.

Each data structure and algorithm has its own separate README with further explanations and code.

This repo is used to track my learning through this journey, and hopefully it helps anyone else who comes across it.

## Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified in an efficient manner. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Algorithms

An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.
